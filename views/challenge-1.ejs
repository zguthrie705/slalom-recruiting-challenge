                    <span class="description-text">You are a consultant that has been recently assigned to a new
                        client, Transatlantic Transport Inc. This client has asked for an online application that can
                        help them handle the transportation of various goods across the Atlantic Ocean. You are
                        tasked with building this web app from the ground up.</span>
                    <span class="description-text">For the first sprint, the lead on your project wants you to generate the
                        foundation for the project by creating a basic, containerized web server. When a GET request
                        is made to the root path, the server should send a basic response ("Web server initialized!")
                        to showcase the fact that the server is running. This web server should be set up with a
                        Dockerfile that generates a functional Docker image from the server source code.</span>
                    <span class="description-text">Submit your source code for the web server and the Dockerfile to
                        your solutions repository. An autograder will build your image from the code and Dockerfile,
                        containerize the image, and send a request to the root path. If your server responds back
                        correctly, you will move on to the next round.
